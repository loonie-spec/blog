The graph shows how Korea has changed following Corona-19 shock.</h3>\n<p>#</p>\n\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//plotly.com/~looni/14.embed?logo=false&amp;link=false\"></iframe>\n\n<p><strong>1. 20 Jan 2020: The first confirmed case in South Korea</strong>\nA 35-year-old Chinese female from Wuhan, China is found to be infected on arrival at the airport. She had a high temperature the day before travelling, but with no history of visiting a live animal market in Wuhan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. 20 Feb 2020: The first case of large-scale local transmission</strong>\n909 new cases are found on 20 February among Sincheonji Church of Jesus members in the southeastern city of Daegu in Korea. It shows that the virus is particularly infectious in crowded and compact spaces. By March 8, the number of infections traced to the church is 4,482.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. 9 Mar 2020: Mask rationing system kicks off</strong>\nSouth Korea launches a mask rationing system. It allows citizens to buy up to two face protective masks from chemists on designated days of the week. Up to 250 masks are supplied to each shop on a daily basis. Due to growing demand, the public has been frustrated to get masks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. 23 Mar 2020: Impose strict social distancing measures</strong>\nAs total cases reach nearly 9,000, the South Korean government implement strict social distancing measures for two weeks, meaning schools are closed and all social gatherings are restricted, including festivals, concerts, religious and sporting events to avoid spreading the virus.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. 6 May 2020: Loosen social distancing</strong>\nSouth Korea relax strict social distancing measures as the new coronavirus outbreak slows. For the past 25 days, the number of new infections remains below 50. Under the loosened guidelines, schools, museums and other public facilities will gradually reopen.</p>\n\n<p>#</p>\n\n<p><strong>10 keywords by period</strong></p>\n<iframe width=\"900\" height=\"800\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"//plotly.com/~looni/12.embed?logo=false&amp;link=false\"></iframe>\n\n<p>#</p>\n<h5 id=\"will-government-play-a-bigger-role\">Will government play a bigger role?</h5>\n\n<p>The new coronavirus was all over the news after the outbreak. To understand the narrative of the news, I extracted over 2000 searchable media reports from Naver News by period and analysed frequently used words since 20 January 2020 when the first confirmed case was reported.</p>\n\n<p>In the result, “government”, “president”, and “prime minister” appeared frequently. It suggests that people showed a great interest in governments’ response to the pandemic.</p>\n\n<p>From January 21 to early February when the country’s first confirmed cases were found, terms related to the origin of the new virus, such as “Wuhan”, “pneumonia”, and “symptoms” were dominant.</p>\n\n<p>At the end of February, when large-scale confirmed cases occurred at a church in Daegu in Korea, terms related to the explosive cases such as ‘Daegu’, ‘Sincheonji’, and ‘self-Isolation’ emerged.</p>\n\n<p>From mid-March, the volume of common terms used to describe governments, such as “president”, “prime minister”, and “government” increased. At the time Italy and Spain were on lockdown and the number of new cases and deaths in the United States increased.</p>\n\n<p>From the end of March “vaccine” and “cure” emerged as the human trials of coronavirus vaccine began in April. Early clinical trials of vaccine began at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in the US and the University of Oxford in the UK.</p>\n\n<p>As the uncertainty about the future has increased due to the new virus that no one has experienced, it is expected that the eyes and ears of public opinion will be focused on the decisions of each government for the time being.</p>",

      "content": "<p class=\"message\"><strong>Hello!</strong> I recently published the visual journalism project <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/korean/news-52601647\">그래프로 보는 이전과 달라진 한국</a> in BBC’s Korean Service on 11 May. This post covers techniques and approaches applied to text mining and visualising the data.</p>\n\n<p>Since a new coronavirus outbreak was reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 for the first time, the outbreak has been all over the media. My focus is on the Korean media’s coverage of the corona crisis and visualising it.</p>\n\n<p>The process is broken down into three stages:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>1 Web Scraping</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>2 Natural Language Processing</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>3 Visualising</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"1-web-scraping\">1 Web Scraping</h3>\n\n<p>Using the news search function of Naver News<sup id=\"a1\"><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/korean/news-52601647\">1</a></sup> I collected news articles by keyword ‘Corona19(코로나19 in Korean)’ and by date from 20 Jan 2020 to 30 April 2020.</p>\n\n<p>The search keyword Corona19 is a common name that Korean media call Covid-19. I set the date range from 20 January, the day the first confirmed case was announced on in Korea. Then, I scrapped the website every 10 days.</p>\n\n<p>There are three ways to scrape news articles from Naver News on R:\nrvest(R package), Naver Open API, N2H4<sup id=\"a2\"><a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2576893\">2</a></sup> (R package)</p>\n\n<p>‘rvest’ is the most reliable package I can use to crawl the website for a specific date range.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"2-natural-language-processing\">2 Natural Language Processing</h3>\n\n<p>The first step to analyse articles was to break down the text into separate sentences. In this study, the Korean morphological analyser KoNLP was used for morpheme analysis. KoNLP is the only Korean natural language processing toolkit on R. With the SimplePos22 function of KoNLP I was able to extract nouns from the news articles and POS tagging.</p>\n\n<p>The most complex part was identifying stop words. KoNLP can flag and filter them out by checking a hardcoded list of known stop words, as in the code below.\nI could also use the buildDictionary function to add stop words to delete. Since I didn’t need “coronavirus infection(코로나바이러스 감염증)”, I added them into the dictionary let delete them.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>add\\_words &lt;- c(\"코로나바이러스 감염증\")\nbuildDictionary(user\\_dic = data.frame(add\\_words, rep(\"ncn\", length(add\\_words))), replace\\_usr\\_dic = T)\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<h3 id=\"3-visualising\">3 Visualising</h3>\n\n<p>To explore the most frequently used top 10 keywords by period I created an interactive bubble chart with the drop-down list for filtering date ranges.</p>\n\n<p>Normally word cloud are used to visualise words that appear the most frequently in the source. But my intention is compared keywords by period. The bubble chart with the drop-down list does the job better in such a case.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2576893\">An English-language version of the bubble chart</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"flourish-embed flourish-hierarchy\" data-src=\"visualisation/2576893\" data-url=\"https://flo.uri.sh/visualisation/2576893/embed\"><script src=\"https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js\"></script></div>\n\n<p>I created interactive bubble charts as well. You can see how I created them when you click the links below.\nWhich one do you like the most?</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/looniii/pen/KKVPYQx\">packed bubble chart</a>\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56850104/83661529-2ae15080-a5be-11ea-8a1e-e1e11909b2d6.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-03 at 17 14 02\" /></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://codepen.io/looniii/pen/YzwKMLp\">split packed bubble chart</a>\n<img src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56850104/83661543-2e74d780-a5be-11ea-9dc8-3493db6cc4a5.png\" alt=\"Screenshot 2020-06-03 at 17 15 35\" /></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"one-more-thing\">One more thing</h3>\n\n<p>Translating is an extra step in workflow for sharing the dataset with colleagues and tutors who speak different languages.</p>\n\n<p>My initial plan was extracting more than 200 keywords each period to compare the main content of the news articles. Google translation API is a good option to translate a large amount of text.</p>\n\n<p>I contacted engineers involved in making KoLNP to find a suitable machine translation for the Korean language.\nChel-Hee Lee, who is an adjunct assistant professor of University of Calgary in Canada, said;\n“It may be a good idea to use GoogleLanguageR to translate into English. However, it is necessary to translate manually. Translation is a subjective matter at the end.”\nHe also said that natural language processing is a highly subjective matter.</p>\n\n<p>I agree with him. Tools make you life easier, but you have to know how to use them.</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/korean/news-52601647\">1</a> Naver is the leading portal site in Korea. Its news service Naver News(http://news.naver.com) is a news aggregator website that takes a large portion of news consumption in Korea. It currently sources content from 52 news outlets in real-time. The site stores the articles on its database and presents all of them on its website. It means being able to read all news articles in real-time from all major news outlets on one website in one standardised format. Therefore, it is the place for scraping news articles.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/2576893\">2</a> N2H4 is the R package for Naver News Text Crawling.
